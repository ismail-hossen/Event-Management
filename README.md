## I have a business, related to corporate events management or services industry. So for the business i build a system with some interesting features using React and Firebase.

## Here's i explain about some features:

- ### Firstly if users land in home page of the system users can see a navigation bar and a banner and if users scroll down to the page users can see a services section and a footer and more.

- ### In the system have register and login page user can see in the right side by clicking a menu button from the navbar. So user can create account or login in the system to see additional features. If user create account or login user can see a toast message.

- ### In This system have some private things or features. So those things are hidden for normal users. If normal users tried to access those private things from the system the system will redirected in login page. After login or register by providing valid user credentials the system redirected to the users in that private things which is users tried to access.

- ### If an user is logged in to the system the user won't be logged out until the user logged out him/his self by clicking logout button from menu bar. The logout button users can see when the user login or register in this system.

- ### If users need to see service details ( need login or register ) users can see by clicking a button from the services section. In details page users can see details about the event service which button is users clicked to land in the details page.
